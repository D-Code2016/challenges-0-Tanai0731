#Testing Testing 1 2 3

Before releasing any product to customers it has to be tested to ensure that it functions as promised. The team member responsible for testing on a development team is **Quality Assurance**. Also known as QA, these team members rigorously test the best and worst case scenarios that a customer may come across when using the app. Before they start QA writes detailed steps that should be taken to test the scenario. These are called **test cases**. These test cases are then used to try to create the scenarios to ensure they get the expected results. If the test fails, QA then writes a **bug report** which details what was expected and what actually happened. This is given to the programmers to figure out why the app didn't function as expected and once fixed, QA tests it again.
